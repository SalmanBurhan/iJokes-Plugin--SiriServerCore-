This is a plugin with the same answers as the AssistantExtensions Plugin "iJokes"\
\
Since all Cydia tweaks such as MyAssistant and AssistantExtensions don't work with SiriServer, I thought it would be great to make a plugin for it so people can get this plugin. The best part is that you don't have to say "Let's Chat" before activating this plugin! It has NO activation key!\

I Hope You Guys Enjoy This Plugin! Be Sure To Follow Me And/Or Watch For My Plugins! I Plan On Releasing More Of Them!}
